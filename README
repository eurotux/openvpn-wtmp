# WTMP Logger for OpenVPN

This plug-in adds support for logging connections and disconnections
from OpenVPN to the wtmp file in Unix-like systems.

## Why is this useful?

If this plug-in's in use, you can use the `last` command to check
the record/log of connections of all the clients in your VPN.

## Build instructions

Just run `make` in the source folder. This should produce a `wtmp.so` file
in the same directory.

## Using the plug-in

After the plug-in's been built with the instructions above just place it
where you see fit and modify your OpenVPN configuration like so
(please note we're using `/usr/lib/openvpn/plugins/wtmp.so` as an example
path for the plug-in):

```
(..)
plugin "/usr/lib/openvpn/plugins/wtmp.so"
(..)
```
